Yes, you can use also the event: 

init.ora: event = "10949 trace name context forever' 
using oradebug: event 10949 trace name context forever 
system: alter system set events '10949 trace name context forever'; 
session: alter session set events '10949 level 1'; 

The event set like that has the same effect as setting _serial_direct_read to 'never'.
